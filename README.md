# This is my project for **Snake console** game written in **C#**

Here mostly for recording my history of projects or for future reference. Still in progress.

## **Installation**
## Create C# console project manually in:
- ### [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) or other IDEs (like [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download)).
    - Create empty C# dotnet console project.
    - Remove default .cs files and paste all my .cs files
    - Hit F5 in Visual studio or click on run project with button.
- ### command line without any IDE 
    - if not installed, then download and install Dotnet SDK from [Microsoft webpage](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
    - Run `dotnew new console --name Snake --language "C#"` command in desired folder. This will create empty dotnet console project called Snake.
    - Remove default Program.cs file and paste all my files into directory
    - Build the project with `dotnet build` or build and run with `dotnet run`.
